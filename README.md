I'm a 16 year old from the UK. I love to code and learn new technologies

## ðŸ“˜ Things I know:


<details>
  <summary>
    C#
  </summary>
  <p>
I learned a lot of C# midway through 2020 and its now my go-to when it comes to little projects  or medium sized school projects. I love the similarities to Java but am not a fan of there not being trees or hash maps.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary>
    WPF .NET
  </summary>
  <p>
I learned a lot of WPF/ XAML midway through 2020 and I use it for school projects. I really like XAML and kind of wish Silverlight was still a thing.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    HTML/CSS
  </summary>
  <p>
I've known HTML and CSS since 2015. I use it in pretty much all of my projects that aren't in C# or Java.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    Python
  </summary>
  <p>
I learned Python in 2018 and it was my first programming language, I made little games, a CLI and a calculator with Tkinter, although I use C# in its place now because I'm not the biggest fan of the indentations or lack of curly brackets.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    Java
  </summary>
  <p>
I've known Java since late 2020 and use it to code things for Minecraft like game modifications or server plugins.
